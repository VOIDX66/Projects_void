questionable memory.\n","From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland\n","I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n","With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner\n","\"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"\n","\"Indeed, I should have thought a little more\n","How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\"\n","It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it\n","Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey\n","I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction\n","For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\"\n","By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\" He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table\n","\"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock,\" it said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment\n","\"This is indeed a mystery,\" I remarked\n","It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data\n","\"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\" I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes\n","Hold it up to the light.\"\n","'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.\n","It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs\n","As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell\n","\"Yes,\" he continued, glancing out of the window\n","It would be a pity to miss it.\"\n","I may want your help, and so may he\n","A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door\n","A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules\n","\"I told you that I would call.\" He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\n","Whom have I the honour to address?\"\n","I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance\n","I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair\n","\"Then I must begin,\" said he, \"by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance\n","\"The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.\"\n","\"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe\n","Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe\n","Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground\n","\"Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.\"\n","Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power\n","\"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler\n","In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\n","\"Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858\n","\"Precisely so\n","\"Then I fail to follow your Majesty\n","I was young\n","It must be bought.\"\n","Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house\n","\"It is quite a pretty little problem,\" said he.\n","And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\"\n","A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\"\n","She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men\n","\"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed\n","\"That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present\n","You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.\"\n","I shall be all anxiety.\"\n","\"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St\n","Holmes took a note of it\n","\"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you\n","So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\n","Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he\n","I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\"\n","I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\"\n","Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know\n","\"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden\n","So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man\n","It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry\n","He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard\n","As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St\n","I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.\n","Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'\n","Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.\n","There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them\n","\" 'Thank God,' he cried\n","The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.\"\n","At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house\n","\"Some cold beef and a glass of beer,\" he answered, ringing the bell\n","Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you\n","I have already arranged what is to occur\n","It will end in my being conveyed into the house\n","\"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire\n","You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes\n","I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.\"\n","He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman\n","It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue\n","Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess\n","She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched\n","Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days\n","But I hear the rumble of wheels\n","It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge\n","\"But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\"\n","\"They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him\n","\"He can't lie in the street\n","Bring him into the sitting-room\n","I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man\n","Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air\n","It is all right.\"\n","You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice\n","\"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand\n","They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\"\n","She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out\n","I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us\n","I must wire to the King without delay.\"\n","We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door\n","\"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\"\n"]}],"source":["# Construye el resumen con el diccionario de oraciones\n","summary = st.get_summary(title, content, sentences_dic)\n","print(summary)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":252,"status":"ok","timestamp":1729099018063,"user":{"displayName":"Angel Augusto Agudelo Zapata","userId":"07364549780872153362"},"user_tz":300},"id":"h9CZEthYUE8Q","outputId":"7828c66a-44cb-4c85-f73e-3a237c57e124"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","Longitud original 41066\n","Longitud del resumen 9676\n","Razon del resumen: 76.43792918716213\n"]}],"source":["# Imprima la relación entre la longitud del resumen y la longitud del original\n","print(\"\")\n","print(\"Longitud original %s\" % (len(title) + len(content)))\n","print(\"Longitud del resumen %s\" % len(summary))\n","print(\"Razon del resumen: %s\" % (100 - (100 * (len(summary) / (len(title) + len(content))))))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"RQvi3rAMUE8Q"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
